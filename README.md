Always remember, it is devs like you that are the reason Needpedia doesn't have to sell out to corporate sponsors. You are the reason our entire community will always be free to speak critically of any corporation or government they wish, you are the backbone of this community. And if there is anything we can do to support you or improve our environment, we want to know about it. <br><br>

Below we have a flowchart for volunteer devs.<br>
We also have a growing number of other resources available on our Discord space here:

Startup and troubleshooting instructions are posted to Discord. In a nutshell we use docker to run locally and test PRs, just be sure to get approval for milestones from me at Anthonydunn97202@gmail.com before beginning work on things. <br><br><br>

^Unless you want to make an app that accesses Needpedia and loads it in a new and creative way, then all I ask is that you keep it constructive and avoid 'gamification'. (Because once the rewards become the purpose, the incentive stops being to help people. Our actual goal must always be to help people. That's our bottom line) In the larger picture we'll need apps that let people test new and creative ideas for how 'humanity's archive for all solutions to all problems' can look or operate. We're basically pioneers, viewing a vast and uncharted expanse. As the ones working on this project we are forced to ask not only what is possible for the individual, but also what is possible for the presentation of such 'possibilities' to individuals. Or in other words, where others will see a map of potential-space, we'll be mapping out the different ways that their maps can even look. -Or in more practical language: changing Needpedia itself will require consensus, which would limit devs who want to be more creative. So we believe the answer to this, in the long run, will be to encourage devs to make apps that access Needpedia.org and let users experiment with new and creative features (in app), without separating users into different websites where they no longer see everyone's ideas, (without looking through all the different idea archives).<br><br>

But that's the longterm vision, for now we need help getting our own app working. There's countless little bugs and design flaws throughout the site, and you're always free to create your own ideas for improving the site too. Thanks for tuning in, we hope you have fun with this and encounter countless new and interesting ideas. Thanks again for joining us!
